## License

Launchpad is released under the MIT License. See the LICENSE file for more details.

## Git Hooks

Git hooks are custom scripts that are triggered by various Git actions such as commits, merges, and more. They allow you to automate tasks, enforce policies, and improve the overall workflow of a project. In this repository, Git hooks are used to ensure code quality and security before changes are committed.

### Hooks in This Project

- **Pre-commit hook**: The hook uses Gitleaks to scan for potential API key leaks and other sensitive information in your code. This helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.
- **Pre-push hook**: The hook runs the `flutter analyze` command to check your Flutter code for potential issues. This ensures that only clean, well-formed code is committed to the repository. The hook also uses Gitleaks to scan for potential API key leaks and other sensitive information in your code. This helps prevent accidental exposure of sensitive data.

### How to Set Up Git Hooks

To ensure that the Git hooks are correctly set up in your local repository, follow these steps after cloning the project:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git https://github.com/Toglefritz/Launchpad
```

2. Run the setup-hooks.sh script to install the hooks:

```bash
chmod +x setup-hooks.sh
./setup-hooks.sh
```

This script will copy the hooks from the githooks/ directory to the .git/hooks directory, making them active in your local repository.
