# Testing Approach for the Launchpad App

The Launchpad app takes a rigorous and systematic approach to testing, leveraging the powerful tools provided by the Flutter framework to ensure the app’s functionality, reliability, and performance. By isolating the tests from external dependencies, such as Firebase Functions, the app’s testing strategy focuses on validating the internal logic and behaviors of the app’s services. This approach allows developers to maintain high confidence in the app’s codebase while minimizing the impact of external factors during the testing phase.

## Unit Testing

Unit tests are written for all services within the Launchpad app. These tests focus on verifying the correctness of individual functions and methods, ensuring that they behave as expected under a variety of conditions. The unit tests cover key aspects such as:

- **Input Validation**: Ensuring that functions handle both valid and invalid inputs correctly.
- **Business Logic**: Verifying that the core logic of each service produces the expected outputs.
- **Edge Cases**: Testing how services handle unusual or unexpected scenarios, such as boundary values or missing data.

By focusing on individual components, the unit tests provide detailed insights into specific areas of the app, allowing for quick identification and resolution of issues.

### Mocking External Resources

To isolate the unit tests from external dependencies, such as Firebase Functions, the Launchpad app uses mocking techniques. By mocking responses and interactions with external services, the tests can simulate various scenarios without relying on actual external resources. This approach offers several key benefits:

- **Consistency**: Tests produce consistent results, regardless of the current state of external services or network conditions.
- **Control**: Mocking allows for precise control over the inputs and outputs of external interactions, enabling thorough testing of how the app handles different responses from these services.
- **Speed**: Tests run more quickly because they do not need to wait for real network requests or process actual data from external sources.

Mocking is achieved through libraries such as mockito, which provides tools to create mock objects and define their behavior during tests. This allows the app to simulate a wide range of conditions, from successful responses to various error states.
