# Experiment Results Directory

This directory contains the results of various experiments conducted to improve the performance of the AI system used in the Gadgetron app. Each experiment tests different configurations of temperature, system instructions, personas, and other system design parameters.

## Directory Structure

- Each experiment is stored in a separate directory named with the date and a brief description.
- Each experiment directory contains:
  - `config.json`: The configuration settings used for the experiment.
  - `results/`: A directory containing the results of the experiment, including user interaction data and analysis.
  - `logs/`: A directory containing logs of the experiment.

## Adding a New Experiment

1. Create a new directory named with the date and a brief description of the experiment.
2. Fill in the details of the experiment in the new `README.md` file.
3. Add the configuration settings to `config.json`.
4. Run the experiment and collect the results in the `results/` directory.
5. Save any logs in the `logs/` directory.
